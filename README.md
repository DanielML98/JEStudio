## Supported devices
The app is designed to work on android phones, booking apps are way more commmon on users' phones.
Phones are tools that we carry with us all day long and in some cases they work as reminders. Given the app's core functionality is making appointments, it is way more useful to have it on your phone, right?

## Supported orientations
